Music Volume Utitlity for Games

I made this utility to try and help with listening to music while playing games. I've been playing a lot of open world action games lately, and found myself constantly changing the volume of my music before and after cutscenes. I got tired of doing it, and made this.

Essentially it monitors your keystrokes and dips the volume of a target application when the keystrokes stop. I promise, it's not saving anything. If you want to just use the exe, it's under bin/debug, nothing extra is needed.

Eventually I'd like to make it into a system tray application and have a global hotkey for toggling, but I want to test the main conecpt first and see if it has the desired effect. Any suggestions and contributions are welcome.
